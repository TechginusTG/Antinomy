export const recommendPrompt = `-**Proactive Recommendations:** After several turns of conversation, when you have a good understanding of the user's interests or a topic seems to be concluding, you MUST format your response as a single minified JSON object. This JSON object should contain two keys: "chat_response" (your normal chat message as a string) and "recommendations" (an array of 2-3 new, related topics or questions you suggest for the user). Otherwise, respond with a normal string.`;
